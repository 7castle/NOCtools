Welcome to NOCtools
====================

A mixed bag collection of tools and utilities for NOC engineers.

Developed by [Open Solutions](http://www.opensolutions.ie/), Dublin, Ireland - *Internet infrasructure specialists*.

Overview
-----------

**NOCtools** is a mixed bag of tools and utilities that are useful for NOC engineers.
This project originally started out as a way to highlight and utilise our
[OSS_SNMP](https://github.com/opensolutions/OSS_SNMP) library (*a PHP SNMP library for people who hate SNMP*).

It since grew into a way to graphically present information on network topology that is normally
difficult and cumbersome to do by logging into individual devices. Such information includes a
discovered L2 topology by CDP, using this to present rapid-PVST or MST port roles and so forth.

Behind the Tools
-----------------

**NOCtools** is written in PHP using the [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) (V1.x)
as the application controller and using [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) as the templating engine.
There is no real reliance on external libraries besides both of these and
[OSS_SNMP](https://github.com/opensolutions/OSS_SNMP) and
[OSS-Framework](https://github.com/opensolutions/OSS-Framework). The frontend is thanks 
to [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

**NOCtools** is open source software which is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/opensolutions/NOCtools).
You can fork us, follow us, raise tickets and - hopefully - raise some pull requests with new tools and features!
